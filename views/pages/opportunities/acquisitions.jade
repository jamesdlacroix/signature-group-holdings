        h1 Company Acquisitions

        h2 Overview
        p Signature Group Holdings, Inc. is seeking to invest its capital in large, well-managed and consistently profitable businesses concentrated primarily in the United States industrial and commercial marketplace.

        h2 Investment Criteria
        ul
          li EBITDA of  $50+ million
          li Proven and committed management team with the ability to operate with relative autonomy
          li Industry agnostic
          li Market leading or niche oriented, sustainable businesses that can be held long-term
          li Companies with operations that are not capital intensive

        h2 Signatureâ€™s Advantage
        p Signature is able to be creative and flexible in terms of consideration and structure.  In addition to cash, Signature has widely-held public equity to utilize as consideration, enabling all stakeholders to participate in the growth and value creation of the entire Signature enterprise.
        p Under its public company structure, Signature has permanent capital and a level of long-term stability which is superior to that of most private equity and leveraged buyout funds.  
        p Signature currently reports federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOL) of $889 million.  As a result, cash flow generated by its consolidated operations compounds at a substantially faster rate than in other, taxable structures.  This ability, in turn allows for an accelerated debt reduction and a concomitant creation of equity.  Our companies are thus better positioned for strategic corporate activities such as acquisitions and capital investments.
