        p Signature’s primary competitors in providing debt financing and equity capital for middle-market companies include commercial and investment banks, public and private funds, business development companies, commercial finance companies, private equity funds and high net worth individuals. Additionally, because competition for transactions such as those Signature plans to target generally has increased among alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, those entities have begun to invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in, including middle-market companies.

        h2 When was Signature Group Holdings, Inc. formed?
        p Signature is the corporate successor to Fremont General Corporation ("FGC"), which was a publicly traded financial services holding company.

        p A new Board of Directors was appointed, and shortly thereafter a new management team was put in place. Signature has a new business model, though it continues to manage certain legacy assets of FGC. Unlike FGC, Signature will not originate subprime mortgage loans.

        h2 What are the “legacy assets”?
        p Signature has legacy assets related to Fremont's prior businesses, including a residential mortgage portfolio, residential real estate and certain other investments. These legacy assets are being managed to maximize recoveries and value for shareholders and will be redeployed into the Company’s business strategy over time.

        h2 What is a Net Operating Loss (NOL)?
        p When a company generates negative taxable income, it incurs net operating losses that can offset future tax payments. Signature intends to utilize the NOLs that it generated over the past several years to offset future taxable income generated by the Company.

        p No. The “FMT” stock ticker was changed to SGGH upon the emergence from bankruptcy in June 2010. 

        h2 If I held “FMT” stock at the time of the bankruptcy filing, does that mean I now own “SGGH” stock?
        p Yes.
